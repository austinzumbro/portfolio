        <p>I love stories.</p>
        <p>
          I love consuming them, making them, recycling them, picking them apart
          and putting them back together. Stories are the means by which we
          structure the world around us. They are how we connect the dots
          between Point A and Point B. Every solution to every problem is a
          story, whether it be a conversation, an algorithm, a game or a song.
          It has been my pleasure to participate in many storytelling projects
          over the years. This page collects a few of my favorites.
